xtendosgi
=========

Annotation and utils in xtend to remove some boilerplate for common osgi use-cases.

Currently a placeholder. But more things to come soon.

TODO
====

* Support for felix and eclipse
* Auto-generated Java bean to osgi Bundle
* Auto-generated Manifest (active annotation)
* Auto-generated Lifecycle methods (active annotation)
* Parameterize policies
* Example projects:
  * (PRNG) entropy provider

IDEAS
=====

... the usual defaults over configuration options...
